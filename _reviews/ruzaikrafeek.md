*Ben was very professional during the entire mock interview. We did a "Data Structures and Algorithms" session. He was very attentive throughout the interview and gave me a real life interview experience. I really appreciate his enthusiasm and effort! Huge thanks!*
*Did a Systems Design question walkthrough. Ben is really good at this subject too. He taught me how to progress from one iteration of the high-level design to the next step by step.*
*Great mock interview!*
