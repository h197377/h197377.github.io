*beijiez has a good mentorship. He not only helped me to do the mock interviews but also helped me to prepare for the BQ interviews. Also, I had a better insight into the OOD coding interview after practicing with him. He can give the most useful advice and tips which are difficult to be found at any other online course. Thank you!*
*The seller is professional and helped me to understand both inside and outside about the interviews. Also answered my questions about BQ and gave some examples to help me understand the main concept. I recommend this seller objectively.*
